  <h2>How to be natural during a photoshoot</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Makeup</summary>
    <p>
      For headshots, you want natural-look makeup. “Light” makeup is suitable as long as it is natural and evenly applied. It is more important to aim for a natural look than “light.” Although both can be accomplished simultaneously, it is important to prevent an uneven application. To avoid this, use a minimum amount that ensures uniformity. Also, don’t be afraid to apply setting powder, more than when you are making up for in-person activities, say, going to a workplace or a party. What you need is even coverage combined with natural look finish.
    Always a good start is clean and healthy skin, well moisturized. Use primer where appropriate.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Eyes</summary>
    <p>
      For natural look headshots like actress audition or corporate bio, there is no need to use heavy eye makeup at all. But if you are going for more styled photographs, the eye accents should be one notch darker or vibrant.
    </p>
  </details> 
  <details> 
    <summary>Lips</summary>
    <p>The color of the lips should be one notch darker than the best look in person. The lips should be shifted in the direction of darker red. Also, lip gloss is often used in making the lips fuller.
